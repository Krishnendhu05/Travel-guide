The TripWhiz is an interactive web-based platform designed to help users discover and explore tourist destinations with ease. The app offers personalized recommendations, a powerful search feature for attractions and accommodations, and an intuitive dashboard for managing travel plans.
Users can sign up, log in, and can easily access the website.

## Problem statement
Travel planning can often be a time-consuming and overwhelming process, especially for individuals unfamiliar with a destination. Common challenges include:

1.Lack of Personalized Recommendations – Travelers struggle to find places that match their interests, leading to inefficient planning.
2.Scattered Information – Users have to browse multiple websites for tourist attractions, accommodations, and local services.
3.Group Travel Coordination – Planning a trip with friends or family becomes difficult due to miscommunication and lack of a shared itinerary.
4.Data and Preferences Management – Users lack a centralized platform to save recent searches, itineraries, and past trips.

## The solution
The Travel Guide App simplifies trip planning by providing:
✅ A personalized dashboard displaying recommended destinations and user-specific preferences.
✅ A one-stop platform integrating tourist spots, nearby accommodations, and travel details.
✅ A group planning feature allowing users to create rooms, collaborate, and plan together seamlessly.
✅ A secure and user-friendly interface for saving trip details, recent searches, and travel history.

By addressing these pain points, the TripWhiz enhances the travel experience, making it more efficient, collaborative, and enjoyable.
